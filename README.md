**Herb Hunter: Medicinal Plant Detection Using Machine Learning**


__Overview__

Herb Hunter is a web-based application designed to identify medicinal plants from user-uploaded images. By leveraging the power of ResNet50, a convolutional neural network (CNN), the application accurately classifies plant species and provides detailed information about their medicinal properties.


__Features__

🌿 Accurate Plant Identification: Powered by ResNet50, trained on a diverse dataset of medicinal plants.

🖼️ User-Friendly Interface: Simple to use—upload an image, and the app returns the plant name along with additional details.

📚 Educational Tool: Includes information about the plant’s uses and habitat.

📱 Future Expansion: Plans to integrate real-time camera detection, mobile app support, and multi-language features.


**Technologies Used**

*Backend: Python, TensorFlow, Keras (ResNet50 model)

*Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

*Deployment: Flask, OpenCV, Docker


**Future Scope**

*Mobile app with real-time camera-based plant detection

*Multi-language support for a global audience

*Expanded plant species database
